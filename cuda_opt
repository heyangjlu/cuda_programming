Performance tuning on NVIDIA GPUs requires optimizing all these architectural features:

Finding and exposing enough parallelism to populate all the multiprocessors.
Finding and exposing enough additional parallelism to allow multithreading to keep the cores busy.
Optimizing device memory accesses for contiguous data, essentially optimizing for stride-1 memory accesses.
Utilizing the software data cache to store intermediate results or to reorganize data that would otherwise require non-stride-1 device memory accesses.
